    "## I. Tool Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Although all three of SAS, R, and Python have benefits over one another, I elected to go with Python. SAS has a strong ability to quickly analyze numbers, especially their web-based OnDemand version, and R is heavily used in Academic Research. However, Python is commonly found in commerical and corporate applications due to its ease of programming and free usage. Python's strongest suit, and primary reason I selected it, is because of the Jupyter notebooks. R offers RMarkdown, that does a similar output, but is not as intuitive to program in. By using Jupyter notebooks, I can write both the documentation and the code simultaneously. This makes this projet significantly easier to complete and increases overall readability and repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this project appears to be simple on the surface - how do we predict someone will \"churn\" or leave the company for another company or service. Ideally, a company wants to keep as many customers as possible while gaining new ones. This data can be used for targeted marketing, creating new offers, or predicting if a new operational change could cause customers to leave. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will use two overall statisitcal methods to discover what kind of causes may impact a customer's decision to churn. It will not be perfect, as I do not have perfect data nor can I get every nuance in any model, but it will give an overall likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, and descriptive, statistical method I will use is association analysis. Since there are headers for multiple products, such as Phone Service, Internet Service, Online Security, Device Protection, Technical Support, Streaming TV, and Streaming Movies, it seems that there might be a relationship between purchasing certain product and whether they will churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, and non-descriptive predictive, statistical method I will use is linear regression. This common technique will help determine the weight of each factor in producing a binary output - in this case, churn or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Data Exploration and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the exploration and preparation is to find out if any variables are missing or would otherwise skew my results. The biggest pieces I am trying to predict are churn, and both of my statitical methods are using binary inputs to determine whether or not a customer is likely to churn. Therefore, we will remove or impute every variable until there is strictly binary options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I load three libraries - pandas for dataframe usage, numpy for manipulation of arrays and similar, and matplotlib for the ability to draw graphs as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, I also load the raw data into a dataframe for exploration. I have renamed the file to shorter name while not changing any part of the data."
